    "From doing women projectons we can see that Theresa Anderson was the most influential and most connected member of all events. We also saw that Flora Price was the least influential and did not actively participate in the events. Doing event projections we saw that E6-E9 were the most popular events attended. We also saw that Ell was one of the least popular events attended. By looking at the Bimodal graph connecting events to members we can see that the most popular members Theresa Anderson and Evelyn Jefferson attended the most popular events (E6-E9)."
